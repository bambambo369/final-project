        <p>
            The <strong>COMM 2020</strong> course has played a pivotal role in shaping my technical communication abilities. 
            It emphasized critical learning objectives, such as <strong>plain language principles</strong>, <strong>document design</strong>, 
            and the importance of tailoring content to suit diverse audiences. Through this course, I developed three essential employability skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#reflection1"><strong>Clear Communication:</strong></a> Conveying complex ideas clearly and effectively.</li>
            <li><a href="#reflection2"><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong></a> Using structured methods to analyze problems and articulate solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Ensuring technical documents are accurate, polished, and audience-focused to meet professional standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Assignment 1 -->
        <h3 id="reflection1">Assignment 1: Inclusive Language Quiz</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> Within the <em>Inclusive Language Quiz</em>, I rewrote sentences based on plain language and accessibility principles. This involved identifying and removing words and phrases that might be sexist or redundant.</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> I analyzed the original sentences, identified areas for improvement, and revised them for tone, inclusivity, and clarity. For example, I replaced terms like "disabled students" with "students with disabilities" to adopt a people-first language approach.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> My revisions were praised for their clarity, professionalism, and alignment with technical writing best practices. They effectively demonstrated my ability to craft content suitable for diverse audiences.</p>

        <!-- Assignment 2 -->
        <h3 id="reflection2">Assignment 2: Definitions Assignment</h3>
        <p><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> In the <em>Definitions Assignment</em>, I created and evaluated sentence and expanded definitions of technical concepts using plain language principles. The target audience consisted of beginner college students unfamiliar with the terms.</p>
        <p><strong>Action:</strong> I used AI to generate preliminary definitions, assessed them against class criteria, and revised them for clarity. My revisions included removing unnecessary technical jargon, adding illustrations, and ensuring the definitions were accessible to a general audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The revised definitions received positive feedback for their clarity and usability. This assignment highlighted my ability to rewrite technical material to meet the needs of diverse audiences while adhering to plain language principles.</p>
